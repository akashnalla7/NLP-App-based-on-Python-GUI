# NLP-App-based-on-Python-GUI


This is a Python GUI Application which is based on the Natural Language Processing API in which it contains three types features.They are:
1. Sentiment Analysis
2. Emotion Prediction
3. NER (Named Entity Recognition)

Sentiment analysis : Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves analyzing text data to determine the emotional tone or attitude expressed by the writer or speaker. It is a subfield of NLP that involves extracting subjective information from text data, such as opinions, attitudes, and emotions.

Emotion Prediction : Emotion prediction in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a task that involves predicting the emotional content of a text or speech. Emotion prediction can be used to understand how people feel about a particular topic or to detect emotions in real-time conversations.

NER (Named Entity Recognition) : Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique that involves identifying and extracting named entities (i.e., specific objects, people, places, organizations, and other entities) from unstructured text data. It is a crucial step in many NLP tasks, such as information extraction, sentiment analysis, and text classification.
